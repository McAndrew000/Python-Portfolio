All I've got here right now is rootfinder, which determines whether a three-term polynomial expresses a constant, linear or quadratic equation and prints the root or roots of it, if any.

I intend to put some hours into numpy, pandas and the like. Technically, I've got a good measure of code in both pandas and R from University, but if I'm doing a portfolio, better to put my heart in it.
